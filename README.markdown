# Notes on the project:

If you want a great walkthrough of HTML and CSS (the foundational technologies needed to build websites!), then this course is great. I had a patchwork understanding of both, but this course knitted everything together wonderfully. From what I can tell, it would be a great intro for people without any prior exposure to HTML/CSS as well. And it's free! Take it!

There's a good review at the end, with a complete glossary of all the terms you encountered. 

# Stuff not in the course that's needed to host on GitHub

- Knowing how to use GitHub: creating repositories, using GitHub Pages for site hosting
- Knowing which files to upload to GitHub once you export them from CodePen (you just need the index and style files from the src folder)
- Knowing what code to add to the top of your HTML document so that it will pull in the styling of your CSS file (declare HTML doc type, head, body)
