# Notes on the project:

If you want a great walkthrough of HTML and CSS (the foundational technologies needed to build websites!), then this course is great. I had a patchwork understanding of both, but this course knitted everything together wonderfully. From what I can tell, it would be a great intro for people without any prior exposure to HTML/CSS as well. And it's free! Take it!

There's a good review at the end, with a complete glossary of all the terms you encountered.
